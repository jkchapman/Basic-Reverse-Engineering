## Basic Radare2 Operations: Hello World

Radare 2 is a set of libraries and tools for reverse engineering / static analysis of binaries, available on windows, linux and osx.

You can find it on GitHub [here](https://github.com/radare/radare2).

To follow along with this basic guide, download the hello world binary provided in this repo.

Note: R2 comes with a dope in terminal graph view for easily seeing the structure of a program and different routes through it. The version in the kali repo's is pretty old I think, as activating this view (at least for me, across multiple verisons of kali) has resulted in loading up a gross barely usable web UI. If using Kali, I'd probably reccomend you remove this versio nand instead install from source.

### Basic Usage and Analysis

To load up a binary for analysis in R2, simple type `r2 [binary name]` like so:
```
r2 helloworld
```
The first thing you should do is call up the help menu to see the list of available commands, by simply inputting `?`.
```
[0x08048300]> ?

```
As you can see, there are lots of commands for us to choose from. You can find further info on any of these commands by typing in the command followed by a `?` again. Usually we like to start by analysing the binary, so lets looks at the help menu for `a`.
```
[0x08048300]> a?
|Usage: a[abdefFghoprxstc] [...]
| ab [hexpairs]     analyze bytes
| aa                analyze all (fcns + bbs) (aa0 to avoid sub renaming)

```
The first thing you want to do is 'Analyse All' with `aa`. I'd then reccomend 'A'nalyzing the 'F'unctions and 'L'isting them with `afl`.

```

```
Now we can start to get a sense of the structure of our binary and begin to snoop around.

### Seeking and Viewing Different Parts of the Binary

In the previous list of functions, one jumps out that would be a great starting point... main!

To seek to a different point of the binary, use the command `s` followed by the address or symbol.

```
[0x08048300]> s sym.main
[0x08048413]>
```
Notice how the pointer now changes to show we are at main!

That's cool and all, but it would be nice to view the contents of main... So let's 'P'rint the 'D'isassembly of the current 'F'unction using `pdf`.

```
[0x08048413]> pdf
            ;-- main:
/ (fcn) sym.main 53

|           ; var int local_10h    @ ebp-0x10
|           ; DATA XREF from 0x08048317 (sym.main)

|           0x0804841e      89e5           mov ebp, esp
|           0x08048420      51             push ecx

|           0x08048432      8b45f4         mov eax, dword [ebp - local_ch]
|           0x08048435      3b45f0         cmp eax, dword [ebp - local_10h]

|       |   0x0804843a      e8bcffffff     call sym.hello
|       `-> 0x0804843f      83c414         add esp, 0x14
|           0x08048442      59             pop ecx
|           0x08048443      5d             pop ebp
|           0x08048444      8d61fc         lea esp, [ecx - 4]
\           0x08048447      c3             ret
[0x08048413]> 
```
Finally we can start to analyse the assembly and work out what's going on (life protipâ„¢: not much in this binary).

### Graphy View

In the assembly of main, we can see there is a jump condition in the middle (also shown by the arrow to the left of the hex values). In particular, a jump if greater than equal on the comparrison of eax and the integer variable in the memory location stored at ebp - 10h. This might be a simple example, but sometimes the flow of control can get really messy and convoluted within binaries.

One easier way to visualise this is to enter visual graph mode with `VV`.

```

```
The 't' and the 'f' on each branch show us which way the program will diverge wether ther condition is true or false. As should be farely obvious now, we want the condition to fail to gain access to the hello function!

### Printing Data

There really isn't much else to show right now, but here's an example of printing data stored at a certain locations. For this, we will use the r2 debugger, so relaunch with the `-d` flag this time.
```
root@kali:~/Documents/retalk# r2 -d helloworld
Process with PID 3838 started...
attach 3838 3838
bin.baddr 0x08048000
Assuming filepath ./helloworld
Version symbols section '.gnu.version' contains 5 entries:
 Addr: 0x08048246  Offset: 0x00000246  Link: 5 (.dynsym)
  000:   0 (*local*)       0 (*local*)       0 (*local*)       0 (*local*)    
  004:   0 (*local*)    
Version needs section '.gnu.version_r' contains 1 entries:
 Addr: 0x08048250 Offset: 0x00000250  Link to section: 6 (.gnu.version_r)
asm.bits 32
 -- Excellent; we can attack in any direction!
[0xf77b0000]>
```
Again, follow the same steps as above to get to the disassembled main. We will set a breakpoint at the jump so we can inspect the registers and print out data.

To set a breakpoint, use `db` followed by the address to break on, then `dc` to run and continue to that breakpoint.

```
[0x08048413]> db 0x08048438
[0x08048413]> dc
hit breakpoint at: 8048438
attach 3838 1
[0x08048413]> 
```
Now we can inspect the value of the registers and see what exactly is being compared! To see the registers, simple enter `dr`.

```
[0x08048413]> dr
eip = 0x08048438
oeax = 0xffffffff
eax = 0x00000001
ebx = 0xf7784000
ecx = 0xff894be0
edx = 0xff894c04
esp = 0xff894bb0
ebp = 0xff894bc8
esi = 0x00000000
edi = 0x00000000
eflags = 0x00000297
[0x08048413]> 
```

We now know that the value of eax was 0x00000001 or 1. If the hex was a little more complicated you can convert it with `?`. For example, with `0x08008135`:

```
[0x08048413]> ? 0x08008135

... easy!

Next, we want to find the second operand to the `cmp` instruction. We know that it is stored at `0x10` less than the address in ebp, and we know what ebp is thanks to running `dr`... so lets print that exact value!

To do so, we want to 'P'rint the he'x' 32bit 'w' value at the specific address using `pxw @ [address]`.

```
[0x08048413]> pxw @ 0xff894bc8 - 0x10

The value is 0x00000002 or 2. This will obviously always fail, and will therefore always go on to print 'hello world!'

### Finishing
Well done on reversing your first binary (ish)!
