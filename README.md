##Basic Reverse Engineering

This is a short guide to static analysis / reverse engineering of x86 binaries for the purpose of competing in CTF's.

The guide will consist of:

1. A short intro to x86 assembly:
  * The compilation / linking process
  * Essential registers
  * Basic instructions
  * Calling procedure / function arguments
2. An intro to Radare2 using a simple 'Hello World' program
  * How to analyze binaries
  * How to seek around different parts of the binary
  * How to print meaningful data
  * How to convert data (hex, binary, ascii etc.)
3. A walkthrough of analysis of a simple 'crackme' binary, commonly seen in CTF games
4. A few extra crackme's for practice!
