## More challenges for R2!

1. challenges.zip the complete lit of crackmes created for the RPISec MBE course found [here](http://security.cs.rpi.edu/courses/binexp-spring2015/). 10 or so challenges increasing in difficulty. Would definitely reccomend you go through the whole coursei n your own time when you can!
2. bombs.zip binary bombs from RPISEC and CMU. Essentially, can you get through each challenge with the right password without 'blowing up' the bomb!
3. IOLI crackmes - oldy but classic set of crackmes similar to RPISECs, great for practice!
